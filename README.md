An add-on for the Sticky Menu (Or Anything) On Scroll plugin that adds a "dismiss" (or "close") button.

## Description

This add-on plugin adds a "dismiss" button to the element once it becomes sticky. Clicking the button will "unstick" the element to reset it and put it back in its original state. When you scroll up and then down again, the element will become sticky again.

## Installation 

1. Upload the "sticky-menu-or-anything-addon-dismiss-button" directory to your "wp-content/plugins" directory.
2. In your WordPress admin, go to PLUGINS and activate "Sticky Menu (or Anything!) Add-on: Dismiss Button"
